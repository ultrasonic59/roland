 *      Form 1 	This is the native internal data format of the receiver.
 *      		Each point of data contains a header byte, followed by
 *      		three, 16-bit words. Form 1 offers very fast transfer
 *      		speeds, and Form 1 data can be converted to floating point
 *      		data in the computer.
 *
 *		16 bit words from the instrument are 'big endian' and must be
 *		converted to native byte order.
 *
 *		This uses glib-2 for convenience.
